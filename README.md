# PAC2200 Monitoring

This project is a monitoring tool for the PAC2200 device. It periodically fetches measurement data from the PAC2200 and writes it to an InfluxDB time-series database for further analysis and visualization (e.g., with Grafana).

## Features

- Reads configuration (URLs, tokens, intervals) from environment variables.
- Defines several endpoints (e.g., INST, AVG1, COUNTER), each with its own polling interval.
- Fetches JSON data from the PAC2200, extracts relevant measurement fields (voltages, currents, power, energy counters, etc.), and timestamps.
- Formats the extracted data in the InfluxDB line protocol and sends it to the InfluxDB database.
- Runs in an infinite loop, polling each endpoint at its defined interval.
- Logs errors during data fetching or writing, but continues running.

## Typical Use Case

- Automated collection and storage of measurement data from a PAC2200 device into a time-series database for later analysis and visualization.
